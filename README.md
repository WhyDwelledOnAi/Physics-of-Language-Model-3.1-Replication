# Physics-of-Language-Model-3.1-Replication

This is non-official implement of paper: Physics of Language Models: Part 3.1, Knowledge Storage and Extraction.

I am trying to reproduce this paper, but the results are not as good as expected. In fact, the accuracy of OOD QA is very low. If you find any issues with the code implementation, please feel free to point them out :)

The environment requirement: pytorch and accelerate only. 

to run the code: first python generate_data.py and then bash run.sh.

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, I have not uploaded larger-scale data or trained models, and I may organize them on HuggingFace in the future.
